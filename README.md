# BAISS
  Present-day blockchain technology is too simple to run any complex projects, and therefore the real 
  practical E-commerce project such as Ebay, will never fit in any current blockchain framework. BAISS 
  was createdto solve this problem. This document introduces an original protocol that is called Dynamic
  Distributed Searching Storage Protocol. With the help of this protocol, BAISS is able to build a truly 
  decentralized computing cloud which unlock all the possibility for processing real-world business project 
  on top of it. At the end, we will also cover the multi-currencies generating mechanism of BAISS.
